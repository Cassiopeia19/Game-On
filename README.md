This is a mock ecommerce app that is entirely coded in React.  It makes use of Auth0 for user login & Board Game Atlas API.

All of the code is on the master branch.  ****Currently, Board Game Atlas has begun charging for the use of their API. Since it no longer works with this app, I have pulled out the url to the live site.  No free API for board games that offers the same kind of data needed for this app has been found yet.
